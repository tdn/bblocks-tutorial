# 09 - Schema-agnostic (Semantic) Building Block (Model)

`ogc.bbr.tutorial.exercise9` *v0.1*

A building block defining a building block for a data model described in ontology standards OWL and SHACL.  Such a building block allows logical constraints to be inherited by multiple implementation schemas using semantic annotations (such as JSON-LD)

[*Status*](http://www.opengis.net/def/status): Under development

## Description

## Exercise 9

Goal: Define a Building Block for a semantic data model

This approach is appropriate where a given schema is one of many possible schemas for the same underlying semantic model, and allows defining the model and logical constraints independently, with re-usable validation rules and unit testing advantages.

### Steps
- uncomment line
- examine file "ontology.ttl"
- run build
- run viewer
- navigate to "Exercise 9"/Ontology and examine classes
- view validation results on "about tab"
- view validation results at [Validation Report](validation) or [build-local/...](/register/build-local/tests/bbr/template/exercise3/_report.json)
## Examples

### Example
#### ttl
```ttl
@prefix rdf:  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
