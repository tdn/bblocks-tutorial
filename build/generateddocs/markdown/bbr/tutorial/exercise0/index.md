Orientation on the structure of Building Blocks

[*Status*](http://www.opengis.net/def/status): Under development

## Description

## Exercise 0 - Orientation

Goal: Understand the mechanics of Building Blocks

Its very easy, but has a few (quite standard) "moving parts".

There are also a **lot** of features and capabilities typical of a specification development and testing cycle that normally require a lot of effort and skills to manage as manual steps, that are integrated into a single workflow - all you need to do is to learn to link these together with the right metadata!

The tutorial will introduce these in a step-wise fashion - feel free to skip ahead - but if something is not clear please go back to the earlier exercises :-).

### **Recommendation - use 2 windows!**

This tutorial is **much easier** to follow if you have the source code in one window and can view the generated documentation, with instructions in another window - otherwise get used to switching!

### Steps
1. Read the [Overview documentation](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks-docs) and answer the following questions to guide your discovery process:
    - How do the underlying [principles](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks-docs/overview/principles) relate to improvement of specifications in your domain? Which best reflect the needs and understandings of your community to improve interoperability?
    - What [types of building blocks](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks-docs/overview/types) do you need to create? (e.g. schemas, APIs, ontologies etc?)
    - What types of resources are you starting with?
    - What [registers](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks-docs/overview/registers) contain Building Blocks you can reuse?
    - What technologies do you want to explore (e.g. JSON schema, JSON-LD, SHACL, Ontology )
1. View the online "build" and "repository" forms of a Building Block register and learn to navigate between the two.  [Watch]()
1. Learn [how to build](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks-docs/build/local) Building Blocks for reuse from source components.
    - note if you cannot run locally you can rely on [github automation](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks-docs/build/github) on your own online fork of this tutorial.

### Use Cases: Schema or model?

Schemas express data models in a specific structure - Building Blocks can combine or separate these different aspects:
- Exercises 1-8 show how **JSON schemas** can be packaged as reusable semantically annotated resources.
- Exercise 9 shows an **ontology-only** based building block with no defined schema that can be reused by multiple alternative schemas. 
- Exercise 10 shows how an ontology may be **profiled** (constrained) for use in a particular context, to document assumptions that may be relevant, for example a subset expressible in a particular schema.

### Use Case: Contribute to existing BBlocks

See https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks-docs/build/contribution - how to make a small change to improve documentation of an existing Building Block, or add a new one to a repository

### Use Case: Develop a new Building Block

Make sure you have a  strategy to define test cases and examples - then follow the tutorial steps :-)
## Examples

### Reference a local file for examples
[Example from Exercise  1](/bblock/ogc.bbr.tutorial.exercise1/example)

In **Markdown** format.
## Schema

```yaml
$schema: https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema
description: My example schema
type: object
properties:
  a:
    type: string
    format: uri
  b:
    type: number
  c:
    type: number
required:
- a
- b

```
