# 04 - Profile a BB (using rules) (Model)

`ogc.bbr.tutorial.exercise4` *v0.1*

Profile another Building Block with additional constraint rules

[*Status*](http://www.opengis.net/def/status): Under development

## Description

## Exercise 4

Goal: Profile a building block with additional rules, with tests

Note this illustrates how to use examples to test rules fail when expected. This is a critical capability for complex systems.

### Steps
- uncomment import from schema.yaml
- uncomment line #11 in rules.shacl and examine the additional profile constraint (B<5))
- run build
- run viewer
- navigate to "Exercise 4"/Validation
- view validation results on "about tab"
- move `examples/*-fail` to `tests`
- run build
- run viewer
- view validation results at [Validation Report](validation) or [build-local/...](/register/build-local/tests/bbr/template/exercise3/_report.json)
## Examples

### Valid under new rule
#### json
```json
{
  "a": "mynamespace:aThing",
  "b": 6,
  "c": 1
}


```

#### jsonld
```jsonld
{
  "@context": [
    {
      "mynamespace": "http://example.org/ns1/"
    },
    {}
  ],
  "a": "mynamespace:aThing",
  "b": 6,
  "c": 1
}
```

#### ttl
```ttl


```
