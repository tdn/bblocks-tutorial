  "description": "## Exercise 0 - Orientation\n\nGoal: Understand the mechanics of Building Blocks\n\nIts very easy, but has a few (quite standard) \"moving parts\".\n\nThere are also a **lot** of features and capabilities typical of a specification development and testing cycle that normally require a lot of effort and skills to manage as manual steps, that are integrated into a single workflow - all you need to do is to learn to link these together with the right metadata!\n\nThe tutorial will introduce these in a step-wise fashion - feel free to skip ahead - but if something is not clear please go back to the earlier exercises :-).\n\n### Steps\n1. Read the [Overview documentation](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks-docs) and answer the following questions to guide your discovery process:\n    - How do the underlying [principles](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks-docs/overview/principles) relate to improvement of specifications in your domain? Which best reflect the needs and understandings of your community to improve interoperability?\n    - What [types of building blocks](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks-docs/overview/types) do you need to create? (e.g. schemas, APIs, ontologies etc?)\n    - What types of resources are you starting with?\n    - What [registers](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks-docs/overview/registers) contain Building Blocks you can reuse?\n    - What technologies do you want to explore (e.g. JSON schema, JSON-LD, SHACL)\n1. View the online \"build\" and \"repository\" forms of a Building Block register and learn to navigate between the two.  [Watch]()\n1. Learn [how to build](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks-docs/build/local) Building Blocks for reuse from source components.\n    - note if you cannot run locally you can rely on [github automation](https://ogcincubator.github.io/bblocks-docs/build/github) on your own online fork of this tutorial.\n\n### Schema or model?\n\nSchemas express data models in a specific structure - Building Blocks can combine or separate these different aspects:\n- Exercises 1-8 show how JSON schemas can be modularised and semantically annotated.\n- Exercise 9 shows an ontology-only based building block with no defined schema that can be reused by multiple alternative schemas. \n- Exercise 10 shows how an ontology may be constrained for use in a particular context, to document assumptions that may be relevant, for example a subset expressible in a particular schema.\n    \n",
